# Image_Segmentation
It's a repository to help me understand the image segmentation models:

- At the beginning to perform semantic segmentation, I planned to use the U-net model and combine it with transfer learning from VGG-16 - Data being trained on the in-built dataset: "Oxford_iiit_pet"
- Second, I tried the same concept with different datasets ("Carvana car datasets") as the inbuilt datasets (Oxford-pet) were corrupt/ showed error
- My overall goal is to perform all semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation
